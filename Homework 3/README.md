# Homework 3

1. Please condense Ella’s story into three big charts in Illustrator. (I’ve attached the bones
of her charts: ex1, ex2, ex3). Design and reannotate the charts so most of the piece can
be understood exclusively in charts. Don’t forget to use headlines and leadins as well.
The piece should have a strong sense of hierarchy. Please do not repeat or copy Ella’s
colors or annotations. Submit as a PDF.

2. Make the health care area chart dance, like in this article. Do not worry about interactivity
yet. I used a fancy algorithm to position the labels, but if you don’t want to do that, you
can set different positions according to the year that you are in. Please pay close
attention to the design and content of the headline, axes and source. Please download
data from the website itself.

3. Replicate this football chart from Kevin Quealy. Do not worry about the button feature.
The mouseover functionality is optional. Please download the data from the website
itself.
