      Social network analysis can be used to measure the importance of a 
      person as a function of the social structure of a community or organization. 
      In social networks, centrality measures this kind of structural importance of the 
      node of a person. This project uses data visualization as a tool to explain how different
      measures of centrality may be used to analyze different questions in network analysis. 
      In this project we will explore the following centrality measures:
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>Degree Centrality</li>
      <li>Eigenvector Centrality</li>
      <li>Katz Centrality</li>
      <li>PageRank</li>
      <li>HITS Hubs and Authorities</li>
      <li>Closeness Centrality</li>
      <li>Betweenness Centrality</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      For these examples we will look at centrality for both directed and undirected graphs.
      The main difference between directed and undirected graph being that a directed graph 
      contains an ordered pair of vertices whereas an undirected graph contains an unordered pair of vertices.
      <br>
      <br>
      An example of a <strong>directed graph</strong> would be one in which people nominate their top 5 friends.
      In this graph, nodes (people) would connect to others nodes through directed edges (nominations). It is 
      possible for Jacob to nominate Kashif without Kashif nominating him back. You can imagine why centrality 
      in a friendship network might take into account the direction of these nominations. If I list 100 
      people as my friends and none of them list me back, do we think I am a popular person? 
      <br>
      <br>
      An <strong>undirected graph</strong> is one in which connectedness of two nodes does not have a direction 
      associated with it. This network may be one used in contagious diseases modeling, where centrality may be defined 
      as the number of nodes that interact with another node and the direction is irrelevant.

      Degree of a node is basically number of edges that it has. The basic intuition is that, 
      nodes with more connections are more influential and important in a network. In other words, 
      the person with higher friend count in a social network, the more cited paper (in-degree) in a 
      scientific citation network is the one that is more central according to this metric.
      <br>
      <br>
      For directed graphs, in-degree, number of incoming points, is considered as importance factor for nodes.

      <h2>
      <strong>Eigenvector Centrality</strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <img src="graphs/g eigenvector centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto class='center'/>
      <br>
      Eigenvector centrality is a basic extension of degree centrality, which defines 
      centrality of a node as proportional to its neighbors’ importance. When we sum up 
      all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally important. Let’s consider 
      two nodes in a friend network with same degree, the one who is connected to more central 
      nodes should be more central.
      <br>
      <br>
      First, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as 
      \(x_i=1\). Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value \(x_i'\) for node i as following:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$x_i' = \sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j$$
      <br>
      <br>
      Here \(A_{ij}\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, where it gives 1 or 0 for whether an 
      edge exists between nodes \(i\) and \(j\). it can also be written in matrix notation as \(\mathbf{x'} = \mathbf{Ax}\). 
      We iterate over t steps to find the vector \(\mathbf{x}(t)\) as:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{A^t x}(0)$$
      <br>
      <br>
      The drawing also shows, the nodes which have the same number of connections are not necessarily in 
      the same heat map color. The one that is connected to more central nodes are more hot in this visualization.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, as we can see from the definition, it is a problematic measure for directed graphs. 
      Let’s say that a new research paper is published and it references a handful of existing papers. 
      It would not contribute to any of those referenced papers in this citation network because it is not 
      cited by any other papers and has zero eigenvector centrality. In other words, eigenvector centrality 
      would not take zero in-degree nodes into account in directed graphs such as citation networks.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="graphs/Dig eigenvector centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto class='center'/>
      <br>
      Here the contribution from zero in-degree nodes is zero; consequently, all values are zero 
      except two nodes which are referencing each other.

      <h2>
      <strong>Katz Centrality</strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <img src="graphs/Dig katz centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
      Katz centrality introduces two positive constants \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) to tackle the problem of eigenvector 
      centrality with zero in-degree nodes:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} x_j + \beta$$,
      <br>
      <br>
      again \(A_{ij}\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, and it can also be written in matrix notation as 
      \(\mathbf{x} = \alpha \mathbf{Ax} + \beta \mathbf{1}\). This \(\beta\) constant gives a free centrality 
      contribution for all nodes even though they don’t get any contribution from other nodes. The existence of a 
      node alone would provide it some importance. \(\alpha\) constant determines the balances between the contribution 
      from other nodes and the free constant.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although this method is introduced as a solution for directed graphs, it can be useful for some applications 
      of undirected graphs as well.

      <h2>
        <strong>PageRank</strong>
        </h2>
        <h3>
        <img src="graphs/Dig pagerank centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
        PageRank was introduced by the founders of Google to rank websites in search results. 
        It can be considered as an extension of Katz centrality. The websites on the web can 
        be modeled as a directed graph, where hypermedia links between websites determines the 
        edges. Let’s consider a popular web directory website with high Katz centrality value 
        which has millions of links to other websites. It would contribute to every single 
        website significantly, nevertheless not all of them are important. To overcome that 
        issue, contribution value is divided by out-degree of the node:
        <br>
        <br>
        $$x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} \frac{x_j}{k_j^{out}} + \beta,$$
        <br>
        <br>
        where \(k_j^{out} = 1\) for zero out-degree nodes to avoid division by zero. It can also be written in matrix terms as:
        <br>
        <br>
        $$\mathbf{x} = \alpha \mathbf{A D^{-1} x} + \beta \mathbf{1},$$
        <br>
        <br>
        where \(\mathbf{D}\) is a diagonal matrix with elements \(D_{ii} = max(k_i^{out}, 1)\).
        <br>
        <br>
        As the drawing demonstrates, the nodes with fewer out-degree contributes way more to each 
        node compared the Katz Centrality. Here the node at the top right gets only reference of a 
        very important node, and it becomes way more important compared to the Katz Centrality; on 
        the other hand, the node in the center which gets contribution from high out-degree nodes 
        loses its importance.

      <strong>HITS Hubs and Authorities</strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <img src="graphs/Dig HITS Hubs centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
      <img src="graphs/Dig HITS Authorities centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
      <br>
      <br>
      Up until this point, we have discussed the measures that captures high node centrality, 
      however, there can be nodes in the network which are important for the network, but they 
      are not central. In particular, let’s consider a survey (review) article in a scientific 
      citation network. The article itself is not necessarily stating a new discovery and it 
      is not central; but nevertheless it is a helpful material to acquire knowledge on a 
      topic because it captures a lot of central research articles. In order to find out such 
      nodes, HITS algorithm introduces two types of central nodes: Hubs and Authorities. 
      Authorities are the one that most cited by Hubs and Hubs are the one that citing the most high Authority nodes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Authority Centrality is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point to the node \(i\):
      <br>
      <br>
      $$x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,$$
      <br>
      <br>
      where \(\alpha\) is constant. Likewise, Hub Centrality is the sum of the 
      authorities which are pointed by the node \(i\):
      <br>
      <br>
      $$y_i = \beta \sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,$$
      <br>
      <br>
      with constant \(\beta\). Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix 
      are swapped for Hub Centrality because we are concerned with outgoing edges for 
      hubs. So in matrix notation:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$\mathbf{x} = \alpha \mathbf{Ay}, \quad$$
      <br>
      <br>
      $$\mathbf{y} = \beta \mathbf{A^Tx}.$$
      <br>
      <br>
      As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with zero 
      in-degree nodes of Eigenvector Centrality. These zero in-degree nodes become central 
      hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a free centrality 
      contribution constant like in Katz Centrality or other variants.
      </h3>
      <h2>
      <strong>Closeness Centrality </strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <img src="graphs/g closeness centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
      <br>
      <br>
      Closeness Centrality is a self-explanatory measure where each node’s 
      importance is determined by closeness to all other nodes. Let \(d_{ij}\) 
      be the length of the shortest path between nodes \(i\) and \(j\), the average 
      distance \(l_i\) is such as:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$l_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j}d_{ij}$$
      <br>
      <br>
      Since we are looking for the closer node, the Closeness Centrality \(C_i\) 
      is inverse proportional to average length \(l_i\), so:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$C_i = \frac{1}{l_i} = \frac{n}{\sum_{j}d_{ij}}$$
      <br>
      <br>
      Here we are using an unweighted graph and all edges have weight 1 
      distance cost for calculating shortest path length \(d_{ij}\). This measure 
      can be used to determine the central distribution point in a delivery network.
      </h3>
      <h2>
      <strong>Betweenness Centrality </strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <img src="graphs/g betweenness centrality.svg" width="1500" height=auto  class='center'/>
      <br>
      <br>
      Betweenness Centrality is another centrality that is based on shortest 
      path between nodes. It is determined as number of the shortest paths 
      passing by the given node. For starting node \(s\), destination node 
      \(t\) and the input node \(i\) that holds \(s \ne t \ne i\), let \(n_{st}^i\) be 
      1 if node \(i\) lies on the shortest path between \(s\) and \(t\); and \(0\) if not. 
      So the betweenness centrality is defined as:
      <br>
      <br>
      $$x_i = \sum_{st} n_{st}^i$$
      <br>
      <br>
      However, there can be more than one shortest path between \(s\) and \(t\) and 
      that will count for centrality measure more than once. Thus, we need to 
      divide the contribution to \(g_{st}\), total number of shortest paths between \(s\) and \(t\).
      <br>
      <br>
      $$x_i = \sum_{st} \frac{n_{st}^i}{g_{st}}$$
